* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

* The fanout is the number of component pins not the individual BEL loads,
for example SLICE loads not FF loads.

WARNING:Bitgen:343 - This design contains pins which have locations (LOC) that
   are not user-assigned or I/O Standards (IOSTANDARD) that are not
   user-assigned.  This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the
   board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in
   extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is
   connected.  To prevent this warning, it is highly suggested to specify all
   pin locations and I/O standards to avoid potential contention or conflicts
   and allow proper bitstream creation.
